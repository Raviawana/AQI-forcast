-----------------------------------
what i have to do

- create one notebook to exlore the dataset.
- saggregate machine learning model for predicting
- saggregate model for forcasting AQI(t)
- seggregate model for forcasting AQI(t+1)
- seggregate AQI(t+1) with AQI(t)


## Research Question

Here are the final Research Questions (RQs) only:

### RQ1:
How accurately can a multimodal AI framework predict real-time AQI(t) using pollutant, meteorological, and satellite-derived data?

### RQ2:
To what extent can the proposed model improve short-term AQI(t+1) forecasting compared to unimodal machine-learning baselines?

### RQ3:
How effective and usable is an AI-powered dashboard that allows users to input local pollutant and weather data to obtain real-time AQI predictions and explanations?
